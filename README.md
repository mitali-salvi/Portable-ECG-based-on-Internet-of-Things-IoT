•	An android application will be made available to the user on which he can view his own ECG and diagnose the faults if possible.
•	Using a Wi-Fi module, the same ECG signal has been made available wirelessly to the doctor on an Internet of Things based application.
•	The Wi-Fi module can be configured to work with a Wi-Fi or use the smartphone’s Wi-Fi hotspot feature.
•	Doctor’s can look at the waveform for the day once at a stretch (or real time) and diagnose the faults to recommend medicine.
•	This can reduce the physical patient traffic on the doctor’s side
•	The processed ECG will be given to the analog input pins of the Arduino.
•	This is directly transmitted via Bluetooth using serial interface.
•	This data will be used to display the ECG on the Android based oscilloscope.
•	This data is also sent simultaneously for display on an IOT based application using a Wi-Fi module.
•	Thus data can be accessed by anyone using a phone or a desktop with the help of a URL.
